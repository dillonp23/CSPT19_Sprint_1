"""
Exercise 1:

Write a function that searches a list of names (unsorted) for the name "Bob" and returns the location in the list. If Bob is not in the array, return -1.

*Example:
    csWhereIsBob(["Jimmy", "Layla", "Bob"]) âžž 2

Notes:
    Assume all names start with a capital letter and are lowercase thereafter (i.e. don't worry about finding "BOB" or "bob").
