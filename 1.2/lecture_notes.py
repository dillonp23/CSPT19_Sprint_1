# Sprint 1 Module 2 - Problem Solving

The U.P.E.R. Framework:

(U)nderstand
    - know what youre being asked to do
    - create 3-5 test-cases, you can actually discover the optimal algorithm in doing so
        - tests should not be too easy or too hard

(P)lan
    - takes the most time for this step
    - you know the problem, whats the game plan?
    - address each of the cases you developed in the Understand step
    - what patterns have you seen before that you can apply?
    - what techniques/data structures can I use?
    - start with brute force if no immediate optimal solution
    - rough layout of code
    - what functions do I need?
    - DO NOT PROCEED TO NEXT STEP if you don't know what you'll be coding

(E)xecute
    - convert your pseudocode into actual code
    - code your algorithm
    - if you plan properly this should be the fastest step yet
    - pay attention to any bugs

(R)eflect
    - correct any bugs
        - make a note of the bug but don't immediately address
        - make sure to take time to and plan how to fix
            - DO NOT do anything rash and regress your code
    - go through line by line and explain the solution
    - test your code with your test cases from step 1
    - state your runtime and space complexity if you havent addressed in plan step
