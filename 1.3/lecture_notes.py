Sprint 1 Module 3: Time & Space Complexity

* Least Time/Space *
- O(1): Constant
- O(log n): Logarithmic - moves towards constant as input size grows
- O(n): Linear - increases proportionally to input size
- O(n log n)
- O(n^2): Quadratic 
- O(c^n): Exponential - increases exponentially as input size increases
- O(n!): Factorial
* Most Time/Space *

Exercise 1: "136. Single Number" (https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/)

Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
Follow up: Could you implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and without using extra memory?

* Example:
    Input: nums = [2,2,1]
    Output: 1
