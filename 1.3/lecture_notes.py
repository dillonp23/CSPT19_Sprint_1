Sprint 1 Module 3: Time & Space Complexity

* Least Time/Space *
- O(1): Constant
- O(log n): Logarithmic - moves towards constant as input size grows
- O(n): Linear - increases proportionally to input size
- O(n log n)
- O(n^2): Quadratic 
- O(c^n): Exponential - increases exponentially as input size increases
- O(n!): Factorial
* Most Time/Space *
