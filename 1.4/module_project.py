Exercise 5:

In order to store strings, computers encode with ASCII or Unicode. In ASCII, each character can be represented
by 7 bits (although commonly stored as 8 bits). With this knowledge, what is the maximum number of characters
possible in an ASCII set?

Answer: each bit can be either a one or zero, therefore ASCII representation with 7 bits would be:
        2^7 = 128 charcaters
